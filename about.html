        <p><strong>Expanding consultancy services by software development</strong></p><br>
        <p>If somebody would have told me a month ago that I would be able to make a <strong>website</strong> from scratch, I would not have believed them.</p><br>
        <p>Not long ago, during the COVID19 lockdown in June 2020, I came across the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"> freeCodeCamp</a> website and started to work on a <em>real</em> code. I am getting more and more confident in the area of web development. Hence, should you be looking for a project/programme lead with software coding skills you are lucky because I am available.</p><br>
